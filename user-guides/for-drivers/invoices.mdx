## Introduction

The [invoices page](https://parceltracer.app/invoices) includes a table of all the invoices created by the delivery organisation upon the delivery/cancellation of orders assigned to you as a driver.

An invoice serves as a proof of payment and it can't be modified or deleted, so your data are always safe against malicious modifications.

An invoice can have one of two types:
- Delivery Invoice: marks the payment for delivered orders.
- Cancellation Invoice: marks the payment (if any) of cancelled/exchanged orders.

## Viewing Invoices

You can view your invoices on the [invoices page](https://parceltracer.app/invoices).

Here is an example that shows 2 invoices, out of which one is a cancellation invoice and one is a delivery invoice.

An invoice includes a table of delivered (or cancelled) orders.

At the bottom of the table, you will find a summary that indicates the following information:
- **Total Orders**: number of orders included in the invoice.
- **Price To Collect**: is the total amount of money that the you paid to the delivery organisation (including the delivery fee).
- **Driver Commission**: is the amount of money that you get paid as a delivery commission.

Here is an example:
