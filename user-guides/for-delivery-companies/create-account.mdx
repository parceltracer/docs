## Introduction

A delivery company is referred to in parcel tracer as an **Organisation**.

An **Organisation** has two types of accounts:
- **Admin**
  - This is administrator of the delivery company's parcel tracer account with full access to the system.
- **Employee**
  - This is an account that is created and managed by the **Admin** with limited access to the system
  - It is used by the delivery company's employees.

<Tip>

### Clarification

An organisation can have only one admin account, but it can have several employee accounts that are managed by the admin.
