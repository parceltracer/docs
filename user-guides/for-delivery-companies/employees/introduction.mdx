## What is a Employee

An `Employee` is a person that works within the delivery company and has a dedicated account to access the parcel tracer portal of the delivery company.

The employee's access to the system can be restricted based on certain rules that are set by the admin.

Each employee should have a unique phone number.

A employee is described by the following information:
- Name
- Phone number
- Branch **[Option]**
- Restrictions
- Password

## Employee Restrictions

When an employee is created, they will (by default) have no restrictions on the system.\
This means that they will have normal employee access to all system data including orders, merchants, drivers, customers and invoices.\

We provide you with object based permission control by allowing you, as an admin, to set access restrictions on each employee to control what they can do on the system.\

The actions that can be blocked are the following:
- ADD
- DELETE
- CHANGE

These actions can be blocked on different levels:
- Orders
- Merchants
- Drivers
- Branches
- Invoices

<Tip>

If you need more fine-grained access control, please contact us to discuss your usecase.
