## What is a Branch

A `Branch` refers to part of the delivery organisation that is tied to a specific geographic location.

A **Branch** is described by:
- Name
- Address

You can access your branches by navigating to the [branches page](https://parceltracer.app/branches) on the parceltracer app.

## How is this useful?

If your delivery organisation already runs on multiple branches, then you can manage the delivery cycle between branches on the parceltracer app.

Having your branches registered on the app helps you:
- split employees among branches
- assign orders to different branches
