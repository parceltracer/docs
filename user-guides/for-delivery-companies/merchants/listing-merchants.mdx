## Introduction

The [merchants page](https://parceltracer.app/merchants) provides you with a table listing all your merchants.

This table is also supported with a search section so that you can narrow down the merchant list based on specific criteria.

As you can see in the table below, the **Has Account** column shows for each merchant whether they have a password/account or not.

## Pagination

By default, the table shows you only 10 merchants at a time.\
You can check the next (or previous) 10 merchants by clicking the right (or left) arrow at the bottom right corner of the table.\
You can also change the number of merchants that the table shows in 1 page by tweaking the page size at the bottom right corner.\
You are not able to view more than 250 merchants at the same time.

The pagination controls can be found at the bottom right corner of the merchants table as you can see in the figure above.
