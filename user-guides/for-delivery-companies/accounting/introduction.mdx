## What is a Accounting

In parcel tracer, [accounting](https://parceltracer.app/accounting) is a service that allows you to generate invoices for your drivers and merchants.

An invoice is a document that summarises a payment process that can relate to a set of delivered orders or cancelled orders.

## Types of Invoices

From experience, it is best to differentiate between invoices done for delivered orders and invoices done for cancelled orders.

Hence, we end up with 2 types of invoices:
- Delivery Invoices
- Cancellation Invoices
