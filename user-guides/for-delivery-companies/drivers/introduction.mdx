## What is a Driver

In the simplest terms, a `Driver` is a person who delivers an order:
- from a **Merchant** to a **Delivery Organisation**
- from a **Delivery Organisation** to a **Customer**

A driver can either have a guest or a registered driver account:
- **Guest Driver**: has no access to the system at all.
- **Registered Driver**: has a limited access to the system.

Any driver, whether guest or registered, is identified by the following information:
- Name
- Phone Number
- Delivery Commission in L.L
- Delivery Commission in $.

You can't have 2 guest drivrs with the same phone numbers.\
You can't have 2 registered drivers with the same phone numbers.\

<Tip>
The driver's delivery commission is the default amount that the driver will get paid for each delivered order.\
You can override this amount as you assign orders to drivers.\
If you don't override this amount, the default delivery commission will apply.
