## What is an Order

An order represents one or more packages that are shipped from a merchant (i.e. sender) to a customer (i.e. recepient).

Each order has a unique id called `Order Id`.\
In other words, it is not possible for multiple orders to share the same order id.

## Order Properties

The table below describes the properties that describe an order in the system.

## Order States

<Warning>

If you try to do such modification to the order, the system will refuse to save the order.
