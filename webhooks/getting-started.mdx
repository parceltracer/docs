ParcelTracer supports webhooks to help you receive updates about your orders. Every time an order is **created, updated, or cancelled**, we'll notify your registered webhook endpoints automatically.

---

## What Events Are Supported?

Currently, ParcelTracer webhooks support **order lifecycle events:**
- ✅ Order Created
- ✅ Order Updated
- ✅ Order Cancelled

---

## Example Webhook Request

Here's an example of the payload you will receive at your webhook endpoint:

```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "last_updated_at": "2025-06-20T12:00:00Z",
  "data": {
    "order_id": "12345",
    "status": "CREATED",
    ...
  }
}
```

## Registering a Webhook

Go to the [API Integrations page](https://prod.parceltracer.app/api-integrations?tab=1) in the app.

Click  **Register New** to register a new webhook.

Provide a unique name and the target URL of your webhook endpoint.

Once you create the webhook, a secret key will be generated. It will be automatically downloaded to your device.

Make sure to store this key safely, as it cannot be retrieved later.
