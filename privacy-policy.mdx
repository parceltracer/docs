**Last Updated:** 20-05-2025

Parcel Tracer provides a logistics platform composed of two primary components:

- **Parcel Tracer Mobile App** – used by delivery drivers to manage and confirm deliveries, and by merchants to place and track orders.
- **Parcel Tracer Web App** – used by delivery companies and merchants to manage orders and track deliveries.

This Privacy Policy describes how Parcel Tracer collects, uses, and protects information across both platforms.

**Data processed:**

- **Order & Invoice Data** – used to display and update delivery statuses.
